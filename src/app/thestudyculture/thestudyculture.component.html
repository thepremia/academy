            <p>An integrated curriculum extends a framework with significant and expressive learning including
                assessments and evaluation to meet the standards and benchmarks of the boards whose learning objectives
                are the guide. Learning through integration stimulates the development of creativity, critical thinking
                and problem-solving. Integration also develops Communication and collaboration within students. Also,
                digital literacy, social and cultural skills, prove to be beneficial, providing students with
                opportunities to acquire enduring skills for life. The attributes of an integrated curriculum include
                experiences to develop children’s attitudes, skills, and knowledge exposing them to a range of
                activities to develop and sustain in the ever-changing and challenging world. Integrated teaching and
                learning processes facilitate continued successful learning and there are multiple benefits of an
                integrated curriculum. 


                At The Premia Academy we believe that education is not memorizing the facts but training the mind to
                think creatively and critically! APPLICATION- LEARN HOW TO LEARN-

                Students creating meaningful lifelong experiences!

                 Premia Academy provides a resourceful environment of learning including technology in order to meet and
                master the challenges of a changing world.

                 Within the integrated and literacy-based curriculum, students will make connections between all
                subjects, evaluating their work for improvement while utilizing the relevant resources that allow ample
                individualization and choice in learning at the Premia Academy.

                 The integrated curriculum helps students develop skills and understandings across mathematics, science
                and social studies needed to meet the demands of high school while continuing to inspire a thirst for
                learning. The literacy-based program with the world class Scholastic’s Levelled Book Room provides an
                academic framework that encourages students to embrace and understand the connections between
                traditional subjects and the real world, and to become critical and reflective thinkers.

                 

                 Students at The Premia Academy learn to work together to become leaders and learners within the
                classroom and will be ready to face tomorrow’s challenges!

                 

                Our goal is to make sure that the students are the best readers, mathematicians, scientists and
                historians that they can be!!
