            Every institution has a framework or ground rules that they function with for the empowerment of every

            children thrive.

                    <p>
                        At Premia we believe that a child's health and safety is paramount. A Safe and Positive Learning Environment is key to accomplishing our purpose. It is the launch pad that every child takes off from. Keeping this in mind has been the reason to ensure that all the facilities provided at The Premia Academy ensures the safety of all who enter our premises, including the air they breathe! A sophisticated Air conditioning system that allows us to breathe clean, purified air is only one of such thought processes. According to educational researcher Sheryl Feinstein’s book From the Brain to the Classroom. It was found that half of the learning impact came from light, temperature, and air quality.

Premia's state of the air Air Conditioning system provides a mixture of fresh and recycled air to allow consistent oxygen levels at a pleasant temperature. UV lamps inside the ducting ensure that germs are eradicated.
