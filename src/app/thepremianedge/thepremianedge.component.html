  <div class="panel bg-white">
    
    <p>
        Communication and Language - Communication and language development is about different ways a child understands and communicates, using words, gestures or facial expressions. Being an indicator of fine motor skill development and a reflection of cognitive development, reading is one of the best ways to encourage communication and language development.
        <br><br>
        Personal, Social and Emotional Development - It’s essential for children to feel comfortable, emotionally and physically to learn effectively. Helping children to learn how to regulate and manage their feelings is, therefore, a vital stepping stone for success in learning and life.
        <br><br>
        Physical Development - Children meet a myriad of physical development milestones in the first few years of life, from walking to drawing. Physical development focuses on increasing the skill and performance of the body. The development of children’s physical skills should be developed holistically across all areas of learning.

<h1 class="plan-title"><span>Explicit Areas of Learning</span></h1>
  <div class="panel bg-white">
    
        <p>
            Literacy - Having introduced a thematic and literacy-based curriculum, Premia Academy has a levelled book room –  a shared reading resource for successful whole-school learning, to designate the importance of guided reading and journal writing in our teachings.
            <br><br>
    Mathematics - The idea of introducing concepts for the application of mathematical terms in multiple, yet simple ways, serves as a strong base for future calculations with logic. Premia conceptualizes Mathematics in a well- researched, sequential series, enabling children to think out of the box and relate numeracy to everyday life. Topics are introduced using well-planned activities, developing mathematical thinking and problem-solving skills.
    <br><br>
    The World (Experiential Learning) - Experiential learning is a process through which students develop knowledge, skills, and values from direct experiences outside a traditional academic setting. Experiential learning encompasses a variety of activities, hands-on learning, etc. Students can understand concepts with concrete experience and reflective observation.
    <br><br>
    Expressive Arts and Design - Premia helps children develop their imagination so they can express their ideas in a variety of individual ways within a stimulating learning environment. Expressive arts and design are intended to support learning and development for children.
    <br><br>
    Technology and Innovations Lab - Our literacy-based curriculum emphasizes subjects through an inquiry-based, thematic, hands-on learning, driven by the goal of closely aligning programs that students will experience in and beyond the classroom. In today’s scenario where content knowledge is interconnected, our STREAM- Labs, mapped with the curriculum, are meticulously planned to deliver and enhance the learning process at Premia.
