                    assembles the teaching of several subjects around common issues, or problems, highlighting thematic
                    concepts in which a common theme is studied.

                   Communication and language development is about different ways
                a child understands and communicates, using words, gestures or facial expressions. Being an
                indicator of fine motor skill development and a reflection of cognitive development, reading
                is one of the best ways to encourage communication and language development.</p>

                    It’s essential for children to feel
                comfortable, emotionally and physically to learn effectively. Helping children to learn how
                to regulate and manage their feelings is, therefore, a vital stepping stone for success in
                learning and life.

                <p>
                    Children meet a myriad of physical development milestones in the
                first few years of life, from walking to drawing. Physical development focuses on increasing
                the skill and performance of the body. The development of children’s physical skills should
                be developed holistically across all areas of learning.
