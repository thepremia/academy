                <p>
                   Communication and language development is about different ways
                a child understands and communicates, using words, gestures or facial expressions. Being an
                indicator of fine motor skill development and a reflection of cognitive development, reading
                is one of the best ways to encourage communication and language development.</p>

                    It’s essential for children to feel
                comfortable, emotionally and physically to learn effectively. Helping children to learn how
                to regulate and manage their feelings is, therefore, a vital stepping stone for success in
                learning and life.

                <p>
                    Children meet a myriad of physical development milestones in the
                first few years of life, from walking to drawing. Physical development focuses on increasing
                the skill and performance of the body. The development of children’s physical skills should
                be developed holistically across all areas of learning.

                    Having introduced a thematic and literacy-based curriculum, Premia Academy has a
                    levelled book room – a shared reading resource for successful whole-school learning, to
                    designate the importance of guided reading and journal writing in our teachings.</p>

                <p>
                    The idea of introducing concepts for the application of mathematical terms in
                    multiple, yet simple ways, serves as a strong base for future calculations with logic.
                    Premia conceptualizes Mathematics in a well- researched, sequential series, enabling
                    children to think out of the box and relate numeracy to everyday life. Topics are introduced
                    using well-planned activities, developing mathematical thinking and problem-solving skills.

                <p>
                    Experiential learning is a process through which
                    students develop knowledge, skills, and values from direct experiences outside a traditional
                    academic setting. Experiential learning encompasses a variety of activities, hands-on
                    learning, etc. Students can understand concepts with concrete experience and reflective
                    observation.

                    Premia helps children develop their imagination so they can
                express their ideas in a variety of individual ways within a stimulating learning
                environment. Expressive arts and design are intended to support learning and development for
                children.

                    Our literacy-based curriculum emphasizes subjects through
                an inquiry-based, thematic, hands-on learning, driven by the goal of closely aligning
                programs that students will experience in and beyond the classroom. In today’s scenario
                where content knowledge is interconnected, our STREAM- Labs, mapped with the curriculum, are
                meticulously planned to deliver and enhance the learning process at Premia.
